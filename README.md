##Tools
python django css js bootstrab 

## features

-creating a landing page for
unregistered users and add the
ability to login and register a new
user.
-build the posts models and use
that to build a simple social feed.
This feed will give the user the
ability to create a new post and
view all of the posts already
created.
-create the Comment model and
the Comment form and finish up
the posts and comments
functionality by adding the ability
to edit a post, delete a post, add a
comment and delete a comment.
We will also restrict the different
views that we created so that only
the users that should be able to
access them can access them.
-add profiles to our social media
app. We will automatically create
a profile when a user is signed up
using Django signals. We will
also give the user an option to
edit their profile when they are
signed in.
-
add the ability to follow other
users, we will add a ManyToMany
field to our UserProfile model to
do this. We will also show the
number of followers each user has
on the profile.
ï‚· add the ability to like and dislike
posts. We will add some checks
to make sure a user can't
like/dislike a post multiple times
and that they can't like and
dislike a post at the same time
-make the user search bar that has been in our navbar functional.
add a font awesome icon to create a search button for the search field and we will also
use the Q object that comes with Django to filter by queries that match the username in a profile.
-add the ability to follow other users, we will add a ManyToMany field to our UserProfile model to do this.
- show the number of followers each user has on the profile
dd user notifications.  It's definitely a longer one than usual, we will use different pieces of
Django to make all of this work 
including creating custom template tags using the inclusion_tag decorator.  In the end, we will have a icon in the navbar that shows 
all new activity for the logged in user as well as a way to remove notifications if the user does not want to view it.
-add the ability to upload images in our posts.  We will add a field to our Post Model and our Post Model Form and make a few updates to our views.py 
and our templates.  We will also fix a bug that happens after we add a post. 
 -adding the ability to send and receive direct messages.  This will be one of two parts where we will build this. 
 In this first video we will build the basic functionality and in the next video we will add some extra features that you would expect to have in a social media application.  We will add two classes to our models.py for the conversation thread as well as the message itself.  We will add a couple different views to handle sending and receiving messages, creating an inbox, and viewing a conversation thread.  If you have any questions or suggestions on what to add to this application let me know and I will continue to add to this project.
